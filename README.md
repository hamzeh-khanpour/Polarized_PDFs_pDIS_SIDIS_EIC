# 🧭 Polarized PDFs Analysis

This repository hosts the codebase and resources for a global QCD analysis of **polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs)** using data from:

- 🧪 Polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS)
- 🌀 Semi-Inclusive DIS (SIDIS)
- 🌐 Projected data from the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)

Our goal is to extract the spin-dependent structure of the nucleon, focusing on quark and gluon helicity distributions across a broad range of kinematics.

## 📊 Overview

This project integrates multiple datasets to perform a global fit of polarized PDFs, improving our understanding of:

- The helicity structure of sea and valence quarks
- The gluon polarization (Δg) and its contribution to nucleon spin
- The impact of future EIC measurements on small-x behavior
